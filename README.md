# Powerfeed
  Welcome to powerfeed — a social game where users earn and give power to quality content on Farcaster

  

Each week we host themed games encouraging people to create and curate cool casts in our channel

  

It works really simple in a frame:

1. You’ve got a few thunderbolts to send daily to the cool casts in /powerfeed

2. Each bolt has points that are based upon user’s power score (that is defined by power users engagement)

3. You send bolts as replies to the cool casts and their points are split equally between sender and cast author!

  

You can check stats section to learn more about your performance :)

  

At the moment we’re working on the next iteration of the game that will help users to support quality casts in all Farcaster channels

  

Thanks for your attention and we will be happy to see you joining the power game!
